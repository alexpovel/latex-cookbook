# Automated Testing

This sub-project contains Python-based code for testing the PDF output produced by
earlier CI stages, or by you locally.

This is helpful to check for basic stuff.
A more involved approach is shown [here](https://blog.martisak.se/2020/05/16/latex-test-cases/).
This includes checking for publisher-specific requirements, allowing us to detect errors
and iterate much faster.

## Setup

There are two steps to this.
This is unfortunately not as easy as it could be, owed to the nature of Python's
ecosystem.

### Python dependencies

The project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency
management.
Once you have it installed according to their documentation, it is very easy to pull in
the dependencies of this project.
In the directory containing [the `poetry` config file](poetry-config), run

```bash
poetry install
```

That's it... almost.

### Python itself

You will also need a suitable Python interpreter, aka Python version.
This is "Python itself".
If your system's Python *is* compatible with what is listed in the [config](poetry-config),
you do not need to do anything.
The easiest way to test this is to just run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

and see if it fails.
If it does, `poetry` will complain to you accordingly.
In such a case, [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) has worked well for me to set
up a suitable, local or system-wide Python interpreter of *any* desired version.

The [setup for the CI pipeline](../.gitlab-ci.yml) is quite different.
Take a look if you like, but the steps there are not applicable to local usage.

## Running

After the setup, you can simply run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Prepending everything with `poetry run` will make sure all commands run in the suitable
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) with the correct
packages installed in the correct versions, as well as using the Python version set up
using `pyenv`, if any.

Any sub-commands or flags after `pytest` are courtesy of `pytest`, not `poetry`.
There, you can for example specify which tests to run.

## Troubleshooting

- This project uses [`profanity-check`](https://pypi.org/project/profanity-check/).
  For now, mainly just for fun, but perhaps it can be useful in the future.
  That package makes heavy use of *ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE™*.
  As a result, it seems to be more sensitive about what dependencies it requires.
  Due to [this issue](https://github.com/vzhou842/profanity-check/issues/15), this
  project is using Python 3.7 for the time being.

### Side note

Sadly, an inherent issue is that [PDF parsing/text extraction](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22473263)
is incredibly hard.
Visually, PDFs might look fine to human eyes, but trying to tell a computer, in an
automated fashion, what *it* sees and have it parse that correctly is as of today
basically impossible.

This is also the reason for the hardship of converting back and forth between document
formats.
Converting *to* PDF works beautifully all the time.
It is the way to go (please stop emailing Word documents for simple, to-be-read-only
documents: use PDF).
However, trying to read a PDF into Word will break a lot of the content.
This is true even for the most modern tools like Office 2019 with an Acrobat Pro 2020
"backend", where there's arguably a *lot* of genuine business demand (and therefore, $$)
for such a feature.
Still, no dice yet.
