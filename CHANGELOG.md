## [3.0.0] - 2021-02-03

### Added

- Option to suppress printing of pages list in the glossaries (b75d3d1)
- GitLab description templates (7038798)

### Changed

- Syntax highlighting now uses `minted` instead of `listings`, a backwards-incompatible change (19fbd87)
- Documentation now stresses Docker usage over manual "labour" (6843a2b)

### Removed

- Previous, custom-made `listings` language definitions; these are covered much better by `pygments`, aka `minted` (19fbd87)

## [2.0.0] - 2020-11-11

### Added

- Python-based tests for the produced PDFs (1746e4e).
  This allows the user to automatically run a test suite against the produced PDFs,
  for example checking for page count, metadata and much more.
- Makefiles for the [root](Makefile) and [tests](tests/Makefile) directories, while
  also swapping all CI routines over to use `make` (b4a9881).
  This allows for local as well as CI use using the same commands, and reduces coupling
  with the CI engine.
- Caching of files in CI, for much faster pipelines (while introducing some issues) (28aea76).
- Showcase and fixing of `\abs` macro for absolute values (4d0c6ff, bb11b72).

### Changed

- Git metadata display in the colophon (7c59cbe).

  font (cf79ee4)
- Summary for font licenses (0372475)
- Contributing guideline (56c4eac)
- README info on git and Docker (fa228b7)
- A `matlab2tikz` exported plot example (86dac19, c3e9b09)
- `YAML`-based configs for pandoc (cb39706)
- Proper check for the used TeX engine (de2a293)

### Changed

- Fontawesome implementation, away from the `fontawesome` package to the more
  modern `fontawesome5` (8df784e)
- Insertion of git metadata into the document (PDF metadata or into the printed text
  directly): now based on Lua (6d0cd7e)
- Also adjusted the README according to the new Lua implementation (ed946b8)
